## Hey, I'm Gopinath 👋
**AI Engineer • ML Systems**

I bridge the gap between **experimental ML** and **production-grade engineering**. I don’t just build models; I architect the systems that make them scale, survive, and succeed.

### 🧠 The Mission
* **LLMOps & RAG:** Multi-agent orchestration and cost-aware retrieval.
* **ML Reliability:** Building observable, robust CV and multimodal pipelines.
* **Cloud Native:** Automating the "impossible" via AWS, K8s, and Terraform.

### 🛠️ Tech Arsenal
* **Languages:** Python, Java, Bash, TypeScript
* **AI/ML:** PyTorch, Hugging Face, OpenAI, FastAPI
* **Infra:** AWS (EC2, S3, Lambda), Docker, Kubernetes, GitHub Actions
